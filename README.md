These are some GPL (GIMP Palette) files to import in GIMP and do pixel work for
the following 8-bit microcomputers:

 - ZX Spectrum
 - Amstrad CPC
 - MSX 1 (based on Toshiba palette)
 - Commodore 64

The used values when the specific color is not defined (e.g. MSX) are the ones
I use in my conversion tools, so they may or may not work for you.

These files are in the Public Domain.
